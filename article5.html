<h1>The Residence Zanzibar</h1>

<p>From the outside, The Residence is no beauty: with 66 brown-tiled brick bungalows in 32 hectares of newly landscaped grounds, it looks a bit like a suburban housing development. But inside, the rooms are stocked with every imaginable hotel treat (DVD players; coconut body products; fresh truffles; an espresso machine) and are elegantly designed and supremely comfortable. Of the new hotels, this is the most obvious choice for those who don't like to venture too far from Western comforts.</p>

<p>The large living rooms, bedrooms and big white bathrooms are all furnished in colonial style and open onto wooden decks and 11-metre private plunge pools (13 of the rooms and the Presidential Villa also have direct access to the beach). As one might expect from a member of the Leading Hotels of the World and a Singaporean owner, the staff are slick (by Zanzibar's standards) and well versed: they smile, proffer ice cream to guests on beach loungers, serve picnic lunches in rattan baskets, deliver cocktails in pretty glasses, and regularly change towels while guests swim in the most dazzling pool on the island: walled with blue glass, it offers surreal views of white beaches and palm trees from under water.</p>

<p>There are two restaurants: the gourmet Pavilion, a soulless room delivering a fussy Middle Eastern tasting menu to the sounds of a live band; and the quieter, more authentic Dining Room, on a palm-shaded deck overlooking the sea, serving delicious cuisine from a knockout buffet breakfast to tangy Indian curries and tender grilled lobster.</p>

<p>Upsides The hotel spa is the first one in the world to employ an Ohashiatsu practitioner, who delivers sensuous, stretching massages in one of six spartan spa bungalows; local Carita-trained facialists are also on hand to administer skincare and Opi manicures.</p>

<p>Downsides While the beach is beautifully cared for, its creamy sand swept each day to remove seaweed (which is hauled away on a cart by the hotel's black bullock), the lagoon is too shallow to swim in unless it's high tide - hence the long wooden pier, from which guests can take dips or boat rides. Also worth noting: drinks are not included at The Residence, and a glass of New Zealand Cloudy Bay costs US$30. www.theresidence.com/zanzibar. Villas from €550 half-board</p>
