<h1>Kilindi Zanzibar</h1>

<p>Zanzibar is not the first place one associates with Abba, but the band's Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus originally built Kilindi as a private holiday home before selling it to the Tanzanian hotel group Elewana in 2010.</p>

<p>Architecturally, it is unlike anywhere else, with 15 curvaceous, Gaudí-esque villas made up of domed rooms topped with a blue 'eye' of glass; each villa has its own garden, two plunge pools, a circular living room, a bathroom and one or two bedrooms. With 54 acres of landscaped grounds, there's plenty of space between the villas and the restaurant/living area at the heart of the hotel.</p>

<p>Because meals can be served when and where guests want, the public areas never feel crowded. Most guests spend their time relaxing on muslin-covered daybeds by their private pools behind villa walls, with an occasional stroll to the little spa for an Africology treatment or to the quiet, dhow-strewn beach to watch the sunset. In the evening, they gather by the big infinity pool or sip cocktails at the bar before wandering to dinner at tables arranged in various places: under a giant mango tree, beneath the stars, or on a veranda.</p>

<p>The hotel is managed by an experienced South African couple, and it shows: the staff are motivated, smiley and efficient, the gardens well tended and planted with endemic varietals. Unlike at most hotels in Zanzibar, the decor and furnishings are minimalist and urban, with aluminium bar-stools, contemporary art and slick writing desks lit with Italianate lamps.</p>

<p>Upsides The South African chef turns out simple but delicious meals using quality ingredients: tender lamb kebabs, grilled swordfish on herbed couscous, apple strudel with orange honey and spice ice cream, accompanied by a choice of six wines (all inclusive). It's also worth visiting the nearby government-run spice plantation to see vanilla growing alongside cloves, turmeric, lemongrass, jackfruit, peppercorns and mangoes.</p>

<p>Downsides Although the beach in front of the resort is private (and so free from vendors and other holidaymakers), the water lapping its shores is muddy. However, there's a beautiful, sandy swimming beach a 10-minute walk away, beyond the dhow-makers' beach. There are no reefs on this side of the island, but Mnemba Island is a 30-minute boat ride away. www.elewanacollection.com. Villas from US$1,300 all-inclusive</p>
