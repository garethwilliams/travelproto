<h1>Essque Zalu Zanzibar</h1>

<p>Essque Zalu is the biggest of the new hotels on Zanzibar, sleeping 140 in 40 small thatched bungalows and nine villas on cliffs along the north-east coast.</p>

<p>Owned by four Italian business partners, designed by the Italian architect David Rossa and run by the new Essque brand of hotels based in Dubai, it is distinctly international in outlook.</p>

<p>The main building is a vast A-frame construction covered with what must be one of the largest makuti roofs in Africa. It houses two bars (a casual lounge bar and a more elegant cocktail space) and two restaurants.  Between the main building and the cliff edge is an enormous, double-level infinity pool surrounded by loungers and thatched relaxation areas (around which most guests spend their day) and four hectares of pretty, well-planted gardens, thick with frangipani, jasmine, bougainvillaea and tropical flowering shrubs.</p>

<p>The rooms are serviceable, but not luxurious (the fabrics are fire-resistant rather than strokable, the decor practical rather than opulent). However, the hotel does provide everything many travellers now expect: large terrazzo power-showers and Asprey toiletries, a safe with a built-in plug for charging electronic gadgets, a TV, air-conditioning, and (in spite of there being excellent Tanzanian alternatives) drinking water imported from Norway and meat from Argentina, Kenya and South Africa.</p>

<p>Upsides This is one of the least expensive upmarket properties on the island. The best things about it are the 150-metre jetty, with loungers from which to watch dhows go by, and a spacious bar and restaurant serving excellent mezze platters and seafood. There is also a Healing Earth spa using indigenous African plants and oils. Villas, sleeping up to eight, will suit families who want more privacy; each has a plunge pool, kitchen and private butler,
as well as its own massage room.</p>

<p>Downsides There's no beach: the nearest sandy stretch is a 15-minute walk away, and busy with hawkers. The architecture isn't Zanzibari, and the dining rooms are too cavernous to feel comfortable. www.essquehotels.com. Garden Suites from US$496 half-board</p>
