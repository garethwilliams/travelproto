<h1>Matemwe Retreat</h1>

<p>Matemwe is on the last strip of sand before the beaches give way to cliffs on the dry north-east coast of the island, which feels very unspoilt (in neighbouring Matemwe village, people still make their living from fishing and selling coconuts).</p>

<p>The retreat, which opened in June 2011, is adjacent to the less smart but equally charming Matemwe Lodge. It consists of four private villas built in the 1970s by two Swedish sisters and recently revamped by the new, South African-owned Asilia safari chain.</p>

<p>It is honeymoon heaven here. Overlooking a shallow, rocky lagoon fringed by a coral reef, the double-storey thatched villas are wonderful for hanging out in a hammock on your balcony, or taking a dip in your private rooftop pool while watching fleets of dugout canoes and dhows sail with the tide.</p>

<p>Meals are brought to your veranda once you've discussed with your butler what you'd like to eat (perhaps a fresh prawn cocktail served in a spicy poppadam, followed by fish and salad, and creamy lemon-curd ice cream). Villa fridges are stocked with drinks and ice; the rooftops have shaded banquettes for snoozes with a book; and there are ocean views from the pond-sized tadelakt baths and big beds.</p>

<p>The lodge next door has a relaxed bar, pool and spa if you fancy company, and if another walk on the blinding-white beach doesn't appeal, the laid-back dive staff will take you out for a reef-walk at low tide to explore the pools, or snorkelling in a traditional dhow.</p>

<p>Upsides The luxury resort of Mnemba Island lies just beyond the reef, and although the island itself is private, its waters are public - and its reefs are among the best in Zanzibar. The sea is an absurdly clear, pale aquamarine, turning to sapphire then inky blue.</p>

<p>Downsides At low tide the sea is too shallow to swim in (three to four metres lower than at high tide); and the beach fronting Matemwe village, just down the coast, is where the villagers ablute - so not somewhere for a romantic wander. www.asiliaafrica.com. Villa for two from US$936 full-board, including activities</p>
