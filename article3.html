            <h1>Baraza Resort & Spa</h1>

<p>Architecturally the most opulent of the island's new hotels, Baraza was styled on the palaces of the Omani sultans who ruled Zanzibar from the mid-1600s until the British took over in 1890. If it were not for the 70 hectares of bougainvillaea, palms, frangipani and jasmine and the wide, white beach, you could be in Oman. The low, white buildings, with arches, flat roofs, wide verandahs and barazas (built-in banquettes) are half-hidden by palm trees; the dining-room entrances are softened by acres of creamy fabric; verandahs echo with the whisk of old-fashioned brass-and-wood fans, and are lit at night by enormous brass lamps.</p>

<p>The owners, the Raguz family (who also own the neighbouring Palms and Breezes hotels), 			are the creative team behind Palacina Interiors in Nairobi, and all the wooden furniture, the Omani trunks, the brass lamps and the soft furnishings were made specially for the hotel.</p>

<p>The 30 one- and two-bedroom villas - family villas on one side, honeymooners' on the other, each with a plunge pool - are in the gardens or along the 240-metre private stretch of Bwejuu beach. The spacious gold and white interiors feature big, egg-shaped baths, verandahs and sexy, curtained double daybeds.</p>

<p>The beach - fine, white and powdery - is the hotel's greatest asset. It is extensive enough to walk along for hours, past fishing villages and other resorts and guesthouses, marvelling at the millions of seashells and the waves crashing hundreds of metres out to sea on a reef that protects the coast from Indian Ocean waves (and prevents sharks coming anywhere near the beaches).</p>

<p>The reef contains the only National Geographic dive site in East Africa, and the dive centre at neighbouring Breezes hotel can organise trips. Non-divers might take to the tennis courts, retire to the shady library, explore the beaches on bicycles or indulge in the most luxurious spa on the island, styled like an Arabian harem with golden mosaic floors and silk-canopied daybeds. Treatments run from basic facials to Thai massages administered by Noppapadon (known as Apple, 'because people say my name long and I sweet').</p>

<p>Upsides The hotel shop is a treat: a vast emporium stocked with crafts from all over East Africa, from Maasai jewellery to silk kaftans embroidered with shells. And parents will rejoice in the well-equipped kids' club.</p>

<p>Downsides The sea urchins, which attach themselves to rocks all around the island and can be avoided only by wearing strong-soled rubber shoes while swimming; the inclusive wine (mainly a basic South African KWV) and uninspiring food (from pastas, salads and sandwiches for lunch to, one night, dry grilled lobster served with a broccoli, carrot and cauliflower kebab). www.baraza-zanzibar.com.
