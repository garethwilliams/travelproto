			<h1>My first visist</h1>

            <p>When I last visited Zanzibar, in 2000, my family and I had sailed along the east coast of Africa to celebrate the Millennium and laid anchor in the harbour at Stone Town. After an hour of wandering around, my mother refused to stay a minute longer: the stench of the open drains, the fly-ridden market, the filthy, sewage-thick beach (which inspired David Livingstone to refer to the island as 'Stinkibar') made her nauseous. I wasn't sorry to return to our boat. The menus at the few hotels that did exist were dull, the palace on the seafront was closed and in dire need of repair, and the shops sold only very basic commodities. It wasn't exactly the exotic Zanzibar of my Arabian Nights dreams.</p><p>Just 11 years later, it's hard to find a tour operator who doesn't recommend the island as a luxurious Indian Ocean destination. It has always had white sand, blue seas and green forests (in 1856 the British explorer Richard Burton described it as a place where 'earth, sea and sky all seemed wrapped in a soft and sensuous repose') and some of the most beautiful dive sites on earth. Now it also has a handful of very smart boutique hotels, a few restaurants serving delicious seafood, serviceable tar roads that crisscross the island and, thanks to the Aga Khan Foundation, new sewerage drains in Stone Town.</p>

<p>Of course, not everything is perfect in paradise. The landscape is often blighted by hills of refuse, and many villagers still use the beaches as toilets, as they have done for centuries. Tourists ignore the fact that 96 per cent of the population is Muslim and continue to wear revealing clothing in public. The electricity supply can be erratic and many hotels have to rely on diesel generators. Water is becoming scarcer. And the divide between rich and poor is increasingly apparent: although locals on the whole benefit from tourism, the cost of one night in many of the hotels is more than the average Zanzibari earns in a year.</p>

<p>Happily, many hoteliers have realised that in order to survive and thrive on Zanzibar, they need to be sensitive to the needs of islanders, to employ locally, to provide education and training, and to buy from local producers. There are now cocktail bars and hotel villas staffed with trained butlers, chefs and nannies from Zanzibari communities, clearly relishing their jobs.</p>
